Hello folks,

we have implemented an attention flag in profanity.

The attention flag can be used to mark chat and groupchat where you would like
pay particular attention.

# How it works

Open the chat or groupchat window and press shortcut `ALT+F`. Profanity will
display a line to inform you when the attention flag has been activated and
deactivated.

	05/06/21 15:25:49 - Staff restaurant: Lunch recommendations:
	05/06/21 15:27:04 ! Attention flag has been activated
	05/06/21 15:27:04 ! Attention flag has been deactivated

You can use the shortcut `ALT+F` to toggle the flag.

The `/wins attention` command can be used to display all windows with you pay
attention.

	15:38:19 - 3: Room roomA@conference.domain.tld
	15:38:19 - 15: Room roomB@conference.server.tld, 1 unread
	15:38:19 - 28: Room roomC@chat.server.tld
	15:38:19 - 29: Room roomD@chat.server.tld, 3 unread

You can just circle around the marked windows with shortcut `ALT+M`.
