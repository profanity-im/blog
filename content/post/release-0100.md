Six months and 270 commits after 0.9.5 we are happy to release [0.10.0](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/releases/tag/0.10.0).

10 people contributed code to it: @wstrm, @DebXWoody, @pasis, @Niacat, @kaffeekanne,

Thanks to everybody who was involved, be it testing, writing documentation, updating the website or whatever you did!
I also would like to express my gratitude to my sponsors [mdosch](https://github.com/mdosch), [wstrm](https://github.com/wstrm) and [huhndev](https://github.com/huhndev).

This release bumped a few dependencies. Namely: libstrophe/libmesode >= 0.10.0, glib >= 2.62 sqlite >= 3.22 and gtk3 >= 3.24 (or gtk2 >= 2.24.10).

## Roadmap
The roadmap for 0.10.0 was announced on our [mailing list](https://lists.notraces.net/pipermail/profanity/2020/000018.html). The goal was mainly cleanupg and fixes.

## Contributing to Profanity
To make it easier for newcomers to contribue to Profanity we added a [Contributing](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file which has, as we hope, some quite important information on how to get started. And about our workflow.

## NetBSD
It is also the first official Proanity release that got NetBSD support.

## OMEMO
You can now sent OMEMO encrypted files via `/sendfile`.
